# jEyeRL
## Ocular biomechanical RL environment

The env is based on [OpenSIm RL](https://osim-rl.kidzinski.com/). It includes an ocular environment and an agent trained using Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients method to perform saccades. The agent was able to match the desired eye position with a mean deviation angle of 3.5°±1.25°.
